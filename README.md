# Smartcradle
The main target behind the idea is to provide a help to the parents who are highly occupied and doesnâ€™t have a sitter to deal with their infants. The system monitors the sound and moisture conditions of the baby in the cradle and provides notifications to the parents.
The system consists of components including arduino uno board, sound sensor, moisture sensor, servo motor and GSM module. The sound sensor detects the cries of the baby and signals the servo motor to start functioning in order to start a soothing movement of the cradle. At the same time the GSM module notifies the parents about the condition via SMS. The same process is followed when the moisture sensor detects any change in the moisture level of the cradle.
